            <h3><strong>Why are they endangered?</strong></h3>
            <p>As forest dwelling primates, orangutans are entirely dependent on the forest for their survival. Unfortunately,
                Indonesia and Malaysia have some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, and logging, both legal
                and illegal. It is believed up to <strong>1,000 orangutans</strong> are also killed every year, either for
                the pet trade, for consumption or as agricultural pests.Â </p>

            <p><strong>a) Palm oil plantations</strong></p>
            <img src="css/stat1.png" id="statpic" width="60%" height="auto" style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; horizontal-align: center;"
                alt="Statistics of oil palm harvesting and production over the years" />
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The biggest threat to orangutan populations is undoubtedly the increasing expansion of palm oil plantations.
                Orangutan&rsquo;s diets consist mainly of fruit and, as such, they are found predominantly in fruit rich
                lowland forests. Unfortunately, this land is often the most attractive for palm oil companies. Current practice
                involves clear cutting, stripping the forest of all its timber and selling it off. Fires are then set, to
                rid the land of any wood debris, clear the undergrowth and provide the soil with fertilizing ash. As fires
                burn, all wildlife either dies, or flees the area, where it will often either starve to death, or be killed
                by neighboring plantation workers as pests.</p>

            <p><strong>b) Legal and illegal logging</strong></p>
            <img src="css/logging.jpg" id="logpic" width="60%" height="auto" style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; horizontal-align: center;"
                alt="Picture of illegal logging" />
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Sawmill operators frequently purchase and process woods from both legal and illegal sources, and it is estimated
                that over 70% of wood products exported out of the country are from illegal wood sources (EIA, 2006). The
                sheer amount of logging in Malaysia is simply unsustainable. Such logging practices not only indiscriminately
                remove the trees that orangutans depend on, they also threaten the existence of thousands of other plants,
                and animals.</p>

            <p><strong>c) Hunting</strong></p>
            <img src="css/hunting.jpg" id="statpic" width="40%" height="auto" style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; horizontal-align: center;"
                alt="Picture of illegal hunting of Orangutans" />
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hunting and the use of orangutans for sustenance has always been a factor in Malaysia. Traditional hunting by
                indigenous people has been responsible for a number of local extinctions. Although hunting is less of an
                issue today, a recent survey conducted in Kalimantan suggests up to 1,000 orangutans are still being lost
                every year to local hunting pressures (Meijaard, 2010), and research in 2006 suggest that if local people
                no longer hunt orangutans, it is because they are now so rarely seen, rather than because of any change in
                beliefs (Marshall et al, 2006).</p>
